		<h1>What is a crypto ?</h1>
	<p>A cryptocurrency is an asset that trades peer-to-peer (P2P) without a trusted third party like banks. They have no physical support such as coins or banknotes, are not regulated by a central body and are not indexed to the dollar or gold for example. These new electronic currencies use blockchain technology to transfer ownership of cryptos between their different owners. These cryptocurrencies are therefore only a series of digits whose ownership is transferred from one person to another. It is now possible, thanks to cryptos and blockchain, to transfer value over the internet ! </p>
